                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Hayley Alcorn and I am currently a mechanical engineer in Northern Ireland. I have had an interest in programming since leaving Uni and have been looking for a way to get into a web development/software development career. I am currently taking the full stack engineer course on Codecademy to get the skills required for a job in this industry. My current role has allowed me to learn and use python to send out data every 12 hours so that it can be monitored. </p>
